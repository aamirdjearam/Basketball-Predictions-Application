Leverages linear-regression machine learning to predict upcoming basketaball statistics

**
Quick Start Guide**

Prerequisites:

• Python 3.7+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

• Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download)

User Guide:

• Unarchive the password-protected "Basketball Prediction Applications.zip" archive to a 
new folder using the provided password.

• Start the “Anaconda Navigator” program.

• Locate Jupyter Notebook and install the program if not previously installed.

• Launch Jupyter Notebook.

• In Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the new folder and open "Basketball Predictions
Application v1.00.ipynb".

• Trust the kernel

• Use the "restart kernel" button denoted with the icon located in the upper taskbar
to run the application.

• Navigate to the bottom of the program and use the generated dropdown menus to 
display different information according to the selected player.

• There are 4 dropdown menus, each corresponding to a different function.

a. Dropdown 1 displays a histogram that categorizes the number of points per game 
that the player achieved across the 50-game sample.

b. Dropdown 2 displays a scatter graph that showcases the number of points per 
game that players achieved compared to their predicted values.

c. Dropdown 3 displays a bar graph that showcases the points per game that 
players achieved compared to their predicted values.

d. Dropdown 4 randomly selects a game from the player's dataset and compares its 
predicted value to the actual value, calculates whether the prediction meets the 
required criteria, and provides a prediction for an upcoming game 51 that is not 
part of the dataset.

• WARNING: If the program is not displaying the correct information or is not displaying 
the appropriate elements, please re-run the program using the "restart kernel" button.
